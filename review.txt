These are the extra review notes apart from the code.
Gitflow: please follow the gitflow workflow for this repository. Currently it only has a main branch. You need to create a develop branch from main, and then create feature branches from develop for your work. Once your feature is complete, create a pull request to merge it back into develop. When develop is stable and ready for release, create a release branch from develop, test it thoroughly, and then merge it into main and develop. Finally, create a hotfix branch from main if any urgent fixes are needed, and merge it back into both main and develop after the fix is applied.
Functionality: the detection system is not returning the objects as expected. Please ensure that the detection logic is correctly implemented and tested. Besides, the llm is neither working.
API: The API works but it needs more endpoints and proper documentation and organization. Please add more endpoints as required and ensure that the API documentation is clear and comprehensive.
